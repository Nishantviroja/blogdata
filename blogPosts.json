  "content": "\n\n<p>Big data has long been heralded as a game-changer for enterprises, yet one persistent problem continues to inhibit its full potential: the disconnect between those who build and maintain data infrastructure and the business users who need actionable insights from that data. Addressing this issue, Arun Murthy, former CTO of Scale AI and one of the original architects behind Hadoop, has launched a groundbreaking AI startup, Isotopes AI, that promises to revolutionize how businesses access and use their data.</p>\n\n<p>Emerging from stealth mode with a $20 million seed funding round led by Vab Goel at NTTVC, Isotopes AI introduces Aidnn - an AI agent designed to bridge this critical gap. Unlike traditional analytics tools, Aidnn leverages cutting-edge large language models (LLMs) and agentic AI to allow business managers to query complex data across their finance, ERP, CRM, and cloud storage platforms using natural language.</p>\n\n<p>Murthy’s unparalleled expertise, cultivated over two decades of experience including co-founding Hortonworks (which commercialized Hadoop) and serving as CTO at Scale AI, uniquely positions him to tackle this challenge head-on. Hadoop sparked the initial big data revolution in the 2010s by enabling large-scale data processing through distributed systems, but the rise of new cloud storage technologies has shifted the landscape dramatically. Murthy witnessed firsthand the frustrations of data companies struggling to provide timely and accurate business insights during his tenure at Cloudera and Scale AI.</p>\n\n<p>Aidnn goes far beyond a simple chatbot. It orchestrates multi-step, complex workflows such as metadata extraction, data cleaning and normalization, dataset integration, revenue proration, and aggregation—all essential tasks to transform raw data into meaningful insights. This sophisticated approach ensures that even data not readily available in the required format can be used effectively for decision-making.</p>\n\n<p>Transparency is a key differentiator for Isotopes AI. Aidnn not only provides answers but also explains its reasoning, assumptions, and highlights anomalies, helping users understand the underlying data quality and analytics process. Importantly, Isotopes ensures enterprise customers can deploy the AI without compromising data privacy or sharing sensitive information with third-party AI model providers.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the competitive landscape—with established players like Salesforce’s Tableau offering AI-powered analytics agents—Isotopes AI’s unique combination of pedigree and technology offers a fresh approach to democratizing big data access. Isotopes demonstrates how specialized AI agents can unlock previously inaccessible insights, empowering business teams to make faster, data-driven decisions without depending heavily on data engineers.</p>\n\n<p>As AI continues to reshape enterprise analytics in 2025 and beyond, Isotopes AI and its Aidnn agent represent a promising leap forward in closing the big data access gap, enabling businesses to fully harness the power of their data assets.</p>",

  "content": "\n\n<p>The study is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>\n\n<p>Led by Jake Russin, a postdoctoral research associate in computer science at Brown University, the study found by training an AI system that flexible and incremental learning modes interact similarly to working memory and long-term memory in humans.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\"These results help explain why a human looks like a rule-based learner in some circumstances and an incremental learner in others,\" Russin said. \"They also suggest something about what the newest AI systems have in common with the human brain.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Russin holds a joint appointment in the laboratories of Michael Frank, a professor of cognitive and psychological sciences and director of the Center for Computational Brain Science at Brown's Carney Institute for Brain Science, and Ellie Pavlick, an associate professor of computer science who leads the AI Research Institute on Interaction for AI Assistants at Brown.</p>\n\n<p>Depending on the task, humans acquire new information in one of two ways. For some tasks, such as learning the rules of tic-tac-toe, \"in-context\" learning allows people to figure out the rules quickly after a few examples. In other instances, incremental learning builds on information to improve understanding over time such as the slow, sustained practice involved in learning to play a song on the piano.</p>\n\n<p>While researchers knew that humans and AI integrate both forms of learning, it wasn't clear how the two learning types work together. Over the course of the research team's ongoing collaboration, Russin whose work bridges machine learning and computational neuroscience developed a theory that the dynamic might be similar to the interplay of human working memory and long-term memory.</p>\n\n<p>To test this theory, Russin used \"meta-learning\" a type of training that helps AI systems learn about the act of learning itself to tease out key properties of the two learning types. The experiments revealed that the AI system's ability to perform in-context learning emerged after it meta-learned through multiple examples.</p>\n\n<p>One experiment, adapted from an experiment in humans, tested for in-context learning by challenging the AI to recombine similar ideas to deal with new situations. If taught about a list of colors and a list of animals, could the AI correctly identify a combination of color and animal (e.g. a green giraffe) it had not seen together previously? After the AI meta-learned by being challenged to 12,000 similar tasks, it gained the ability to successfully identify new combinations of colors and animals.</p>\n\n<p>The results suggest that for both humans and AI, quicker, flexible in-context learning arises after a certain amount of incremental learning has taken place.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\"At the first board game, it takes you a while to figure out how to play,\" Pavlick said. \"By the time you learn your hundredth board game, you can pick up the rules of play quickly, even if you've never seen that particular game before.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The team also found trade-offs, including between learning retention and flexibility: Similar to humans, the harder it is for AI to correctly complete a task, the more likely it will remember how to perform it in the future. According to Frank, who has studied this paradox in humans, this is because errors cue the brain to update information stored in long-term memory, whereas error-free actions learned in context increase flexibility but don't engage long-term memory in the same way.</p>\n\n<p>For Frank, who specializes in building biologically inspired computational models to understand human learning and decision-making, the team's work showed how analyzing strengths and weaknesses of different learning strategies in an artificial neural network can offer new insights about the human brain.</p>\n\n<p>\"Our results hold reliably across multiple tasks and bring together disparate aspects of human learning that neuroscientists hadn't grouped together until now,\" Frank said.</p>\n\n\n<p>The work also suggests important considerations for developing intuitive and trustworthy AI tools, particularly in sensitive domains such as mental health.</p>",

  "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>AI tools like ChatGPT can write blogs, emails, and even stories. But sometimes, the writing sounds too robotic or flat. It may not feel natural like a real person wrote it.</p>\n<p>In this blog, we’ll show you how to make AI-generated text sound more human—<i>step by step</i>. You’ll learn simple tricks, helpful tools, and even how to use some code (if you want).</p>\n\n<h2>Why AI Text Doesn’t Always Sound Human</h2>\n<p>AI writes based on patterns it learned from a lot of data. That’s powerful—but it also means:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>It repeats words or ideas</li>\n  <li>Sentences can feel stiff or formal</li>\n  <li>It doesn’t show emotions well</li>\n  <li>The tone may sound the same for every topic</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>That’s why we need to tweak the text a little to make it sound more natural.</b></p>\n\n<h2>Benefits of Making AI Text Sound Human</h2>\n<p>When your AI text sounds like it was written by a person, you get:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><b>More engagement</b> (people want to read it)</li>\n  <li><b>Better understanding</b></li>\n  <li><b>Higher trust</b></li>\n  <li><b>A personal touch</b></li>\n  <li><b>Better results</b> in blogs, emails, or social media posts</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>\n\n<h3>📝 Step 1: Start with a Good Prompt</h3>\n<p>The prompt is what you type into the AI to give it instructions.</p>\n<p><b>❌ Bad Prompt:</b><br>\n<code>\"Write about climate change.\"</code></p>\n<p><b>✅ Better Prompt:</b><br>\n<code>\"Write a blog about climate change in simple words, like you’re explaining it to a teenager. Make it friendly and easy to understand.\"</code></p>\n<p><i>Tip:</i> Always tell the AI <b>how to write</b>, not just <b>what to write</b>.</p>\n\n<h3>🎯 Step 2: Choose a Friendly Tone</h3>\n<p>Ask the AI to sound like:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>A friend having a chat</li>\n  <li>A teacher explaining something clearly</li>\n  <li>A blogger using casual language</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can say things like:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  “Write in a fun and relaxed tone.”<br>\n  “Use everyday words.”<br>\n  “Avoid sounding too formal.”\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>💬 Step 3: Add Emotion and Expression</h3>\n<p>Real people use feeling words and expressions.</p>\n<p><b>✅ Examples:</b></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>“Honestly, that blew my mind!”</li>\n  <li>“Wow, that’s pretty cool.”</li>\n  <li>“Let’s face it, nobody likes long emails.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can add these by hand or ask the AI to use them.</p>\n\n<h3>✂️ Step 4: Cut the Fluff</h3>\n<p>AI sometimes uses too many words or repeats ideas.</p>\n<p><b>❌ Example:</b><br>\n<code>“In conclusion, we can finally conclude that the conclusion is important.”</code></p>\n<p><b>✅ Human-sounding version:</b><br>\n<code>“So yeah, that’s why it matters.”</code></p>\n<p>Edit your AI text and remove repeated phrases, boring intros, or long sentences.</p>\n\n<h3>📚 Step 5: Use Examples or Stories</h3>\n<p>Humans connect better with examples, stories, or real situations.</p>\n<p><b>✅ Example:</b></p>\n<blockquote>\n  “I used an AI tool to write my newsletter—and guess what? People replied saying it felt personal!”\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can add short stories like that to make the text more relatable.</p>\n\n<h3>🤖 Step 6: Use AI Tools to Help</h3>\n<p>Here are some tools that help make text sound more human:</p>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"8\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Tool</th>\n      <th>What it Does</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td><a href=\"https://www.grammarly.com\" target=\"_blank\">Grammarly</a></td>\n      <td>Fixes tone and grammar</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><a href=\"https://www.wordtune.com\" target=\"_blank\">Wordtune</a></td>\n      <td>Rewrites text in a human voice</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><a href=\"https://hemingwayapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hemingway App</a></td>\n      <td>Makes writing clear and simple</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><a href=\"https://quillbot.com\" target=\"_blank\">QuillBot</a></td>\n      <td>Rephrases and shortens text</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>AI-generated text can be powerful, but often lacks a natural, human touch. In this guide, you’ll learn six simple steps to make AI text sound more like it was written by a real person. From writing better prompts to using emotional language, trimming fluff, and adding personal stories—this blog walks you through exactly how to improve your AI writing.
