  "content": "<h2>Why is Apple adding touchscreens to MacBooks?</h2>\n<p>For years, Apple insisted that touchscreens didn’t belong on MacBooks. Steve Jobs even said touching a vertical laptop screen was “ergonomically terrible”. Now the company appears to be changing course. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reports that Apple’s “long-term observation of iPad user behavior” shows touch controls can boost productivity. This shift in thinking is prompting Apple to finally bring touch panels to its laptops.</p>\n<p>Competitors have offered touchscreen 2-in-1 laptops for years, but Apple kept MacBooks focused on the traditional trackpad and keyboard. Recent Mac software updates have borrowed features from iPadOS, hinting at a gradual Mac–iPad convergence. According to Kuo, Apple’s long-term iPad observations and improved display tech now make this move practical.</p>\n<h2>What is the OLED MacBook Pro?</h2>\n<p>Apple’s first touchscreen MacBook will be a high-end OLED MacBook Pro. This model is expected to enter mass production in late 2026. It will use on-cell touch technology, which integrates touch sensors into the display stack for a slimmer, more responsive screen. In other words, it could <em>“blur the line between Mac and iPad”</em>, giving users the best of both interfaces.</p>\n<h2>Samsung Display’s role and OLED technology</h2>\n<p>Samsung Display will supply the new OLED panels for Apple’s MacBook Pros. Its Gen 8.6 production lines are designed for large laptop panels, and reports say Samsung can make 2–3 million panels in 2026 (scalable up to 10 million if needed):contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}. Samsung even invested about $3.1 billion in a dedicated facility, signaling a long-term partnership.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Higher brightness and richer contrast than mini-LED, for more vibrant visuals.</li>\n<li>Deeper blacks and lower power consumption thanks to OLED’s efficiency and oxide TFT tech.</li>\n<li>On-cell touch layer makes the display thinner and faster to respond.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In short, Samsung’s OLED panels promise vivid image quality plus better battery life. The large substrates and oxide TFT backplane help improve scalability and cut costs:contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}, making them ideal for Apple’s premium laptops.</p>\n<h2>Budget MacBook and future roadmap</h2>\n<p>Apple is also working on a budget MacBook powered by an iPhone-class A-series chip. This entry-level laptop will likely have a 12.9-inch screen and target late 2025 production. It’s expected to be priced around $599–$699 and initially won’t include a touchscreen. Apple could add touch support in a later version (around 2027) once the technology and costs allow.</p>\n<p>This two-tier rollout mirrors Apple’s usual strategy: debut new tech on the flagship first, then trickle it down. Most analysts agree the OLED touchscreen MacBook will come in late 2026, while the cheaper MacBook appears on a faster 2025 schedule without touch.</p>\n<table>\n<thead><tr><th>Year</th><th>MacBook Model</th><th>Key Features/Notes</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>Late 2025</td><td>Budget MacBook (A-chip)</td><td>12.9″ screen, ~$599–699, no touchscreen</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Late 2026</td><td>OLED MacBook Pro</td><td>14″ & 16″ OLED display with on-cell touchscreen</td></tr>\n<tr><td>2027 (Rumored)</td><td>Next-gen Budget MacBook</td><td>Possible touchscreen update</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Industry impact</h2>\n<p>Apple’s move comes after years of touchscreens on competitors’ laptops. By waiting, Apple ensures a polished experience. Analysts expect this shift to accelerate OLED adoption industry-wide: some forecasts suggest OLED panels could reach tens of millions of laptops in the next few years, driven in part by Apple’s demand. Apple’s entry may set new benchmarks for display quality and usability.</p>\n<p>For customers, this means MacBooks with truly versatile input options and stunning displays. Whether you use the keyboard, trackpad or now the touchscreen, Apple is offering even more flexibility. By adding touch to the OLED MacBook Pro, Apple is betting that the benefits outweigh past concerns. Only time will tell how many people embrace the new touch-friendly workflows on a Mac.</p>\n<h2>FAQs</h2>\n<h3>What will the first touchscreen MacBook be?</h3>\n<p>According to reports, the first touchscreen MacBook will be a high-end MacBook Pro with a 14″ or 16″ OLED display. It’s expected to launch in late 2026 and use on-cell touch technology.</p>\n<h3>When will the budget MacBook arrive?</h3>\n<p>Apple plans a new, cheaper MacBook with an A-series iPhone chip by late 2025 or early 2026. This model will have a 12.9″ display but won’t have a touchscreen in its first version.</p>\n<h3>How do OLED panels help MacBooks?</h3>\n<p>OLED displays offer higher brightness, more vibrant colors, and deep blacks. They can also use less power (especially with oxide TFT tech), which improves battery life. Apple’s OLED MacBook Pro will combine these benefits with a touch-sensitive screen layer.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>[1] <a href=\"https://tech-ish.com/2025/09/17/apple-is-finally-bringing-touchscreens-to-the-macbook-says-ming-chi-kuo/\">Apple is finally bringing touchscreens to the MacBook, says Ming-Chi Kuo</a></li>\n<li>[2] <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/macbooks/macbook-pro-oled-tipped-to-launch-next-year-and-it-could-sport-a-samsung-display\">MacBook Pro OLED tipped to launch next year and it could sport a Samsung display</a></li>\n<li>[3] <a href=\"https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-sole-supplier-oled-panels-apple-macbook/\">Samsung may be sole supplier of OLED panels for Apple MacBook</a></li>\n<li>[4] <a href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/apple-to-launch-first-oled-macbook-pro-in-2026-report-says-it-is-coming-with-a-samsung-twist-2768419-2025-08-08\">Apple to launch first OLED MacBook Pro in 2026, report says it is coming with a Samsung twist</a></li>\n<li>[5] <a href=\"https://apple.gadgethacks.com/news/oled-macbook-pro-2026-samsungs-31b-investment-reveals/\">OLED MacBook Pro 2026: Samsung's $3.1B Investment Reveals</a></li>\n</ol>",

  "content": "<h2>Ask Studio: AI-Powered Analytics Advice</h2>\n<p>YouTube’s new AI assistant, <strong>Ask Studio</strong>, lets creators query their channel’s performance in plain language. Instead of digging through charts, creators can simply ask questions like “How is my last video performing?” or “What topics are resonating with my audience?”. Ask Studio then provides customized insights and growth suggestions in seconds, saving creators time and providing a clear action plan  .</p>\n\n<h2>AI Auto-Dubbing: Globalizing Content</h2>\n<p>YouTube’s expanded auto-dubbing feature uses AI to make videos accessible worldwide. It automatically generates translated audio for uploaded videos in multiple languages, so creators can reach viewers across different regions without extra effort. For example, an English-language cooking tutorial can now be auto-dubbed into French, German, Hindi, Japanese, and more  . This breaks down language barriers and brings global audiences closer to the content.</p>\n<p>The feature is already rolling out to hundreds of thousands of information-focused channels  . YouTube automatically detects a video’s language on upload and creates the dubbed tracks, which creators can find in YouTube Studio to review or remove if needed. The company notes the technology is new and might not always be perfect , but it’s actively working to improve it (for example, adding more natural AI voices). Dubbed videos are marked with an “auto-dubbed” label so viewers know the audio is translated . In coming months, YouTube plans to add lip-syncing (matching speakers’ lips) and support for 20 languages to make the experience even more seamless .</p>\n\n<h2>Generative AI Tools for Shorts and Editing</h2>\n<p>YouTube is leveraging advanced AI to make Shorts creation more creative and efficient. A new custom model called <em>Veo 3 Fast</em> (from Google DeepMind) is built into Shorts. Creators can use it to generate entire clips with AI-generated backgrounds or to apply dynamic motion from one video onto a static image (for example, making a still photo dance)  . They can also restyle clips with artistic filters (pop art, origami, etc.) or insert objects and characters via text prompts. These features (initially launching in select markets) give creators new ways to craft visually rich Shorts.</p>\n<p>Other AI tools help with editing and sound. The “Edit with AI” feature can take raw camera footage and automatically compile a polished first draft — selecting highlights, adding music, transitions, and even a voice-over that reacts to the scene  . YouTube also introduced a “Speech to Song” remix tool: creators can pick a line of dialogue from a video and turn it into a catchy soundtrack using Google’s AI music model  . Additionally, new tests let creators effectively animate a photo by transferring motion from another clip, and other tools will be added soon. All these Shorts features are free to use, making it easier than ever to produce engaging short-form videos with AI assistance.</p>\n\n<h2>Title and Thumbnail A/B Testing</h2>\n<p>To boost engagement, YouTube now lets creators experiment with up to three versions of a video’s title and thumbnail. Through native A/B testing in YouTube Studio, creators can see which combination drives the highest click-through rate  . This data-driven approach builds on YouTube’s popular thumbnail tester (used over 15 million times) and helps creators optimize their videos’ first impressions with real performance feedback.</p>\n\n<h2>Enhanced Community and Brand Tools</h2>\n<p>YouTube also rolled out features to strengthen creator collaborations and commerce. Creators can add up to five collaborators to a single video, which then appears on all participating channels (with credit and ad revenue going to the original uploader)  . In the same update, YouTube improved its brand and shopping features: creators can now tag merchandise more easily with AI and add direct shopping links in Shorts, simplifying brand partnerships . YouTube also expanded its AI-powered likeness detection tool to all Partner Program members , helping creators find and remove unauthorized videos that use their face or voice. These updates make it easier for creators to collaborate, monetize, and protect their content.</p>\n\n<h2>Creators at the Center: Empowerment, Not Replacement</h2>\n<p>YouTube emphasizes that these AI features are meant to empower creators, not replace them. The company notes it has paid over <strong>$100 billion</strong> to creators and partners in the past four years  , underscoring its commitment to creator success. As YouTube CEO Neal Mohan said, AI tools are “designed to foster human creativity” and will be “tools, nothing more” in the storytelling process . In short, the power remains in creators’ hands even as automation comes to YouTube.</p>\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/778469/youtube-creators-ai-analytics-ask-studio-dubbing\">New YouTube AI tools help creators give viewers what they want – The Verge</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/made-on-youtube-2025/\">Powering the future of entertainment together (Made on YouTube 2025) – YouTube Official Blog</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/news/youtube-studio-updates-ask-studio-inspiration-tab-and-more\">YouTube Studio Updates: Ask Studio, Inspiration Tab, and More – C# Corner</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/youtube-adds-title-a-b-testing-and-ask-studio-analytics/556232/\">YouTube Adds Title A/B Testing And “Ask Studio” Analytics – Search Engine Journal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/10/youtubes-new-auto-dubbing-feature-is-now-available-for-knowledge-focused-content/\">YouTube’s new auto-dubbing feature is now available for knowledge-focused content – TechCrunch</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bemultilingual.ca/blog/youtube-auto-dubbing\">YouTube Auto Dubbing: Everything You Need to Know – BeMultilingual</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/auto-dubbing-on-youtube/\">Break down language barriers with auto dubbing on YouTube – YouTube Official Blog</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/youtube-announces-new-generative-ai-tools-for-shorts-creators/\">YouTube announces new generative AI tools for Shorts creators – TechCrunch</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/youtube-ai-tools-photos-into-videos-dialogue-into-songs-1236519696/\">YouTube’s new AI-powered tools let creators turn photos into videos, dialogue into songs – Variety</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/youtube-adds-more-ai-tools-for-content-creators/articleshow/123926522.cms\">YouTube adds more AI tools for content creators – Times of India</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nbcrightnow.com/national/youtube-ramps-up-ai-tools-for-video-makers/article_28183dc5-2b7d-50e8-9ea5-8083eae36bf0.html\">YouTube ramps up AI tools for video makers – NBC News (AFP)</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

  "content": "<h2>What is the Liquid Glass design in iOS 26?</h2>\n<p>With iOS 26, Apple introduces its boldest look for the iPhone since iOS 7: a new <b>Liquid Glass</b> design. This interface is based on translucent, glass-like visuals that shift in real time as you move your phone or scroll through content. App icons can be tinted or made fully clear to blend into the background, and control panels and toolbars appear to float above the screen. Even the Lock Screen adapts\u2014time and widget placement change dynamically to keep the focus on your background. Overall, the Liquid Glass design makes iOS feel more personal and expressive than ever.</p>\n<h2>What are the AI-powered features in iOS 26?</h2>\n<p>iOS 26 isn\u2019t just about looks. Apple Intelligence (as Apple calls its AI features) adds several new tools:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Call Screening:</b> Unknown callers are automatically answered by your phone, which asks for the caller\u2019s name and reason. You can decide whether to take the call based on the info provided, blocking spam easily.</li>\n<li><b>Live Translation:</b> Built-in translation works across apps. Messages, FaceTime calls, and regular phone calls can translate speech or text in real time. This helps you chat or call in different languages hands-free, with support for multiple major languages. AirPods also provide on-the-fly translations when someone speaks to you in a foreign language.</li>\n<li><b>Hold Assist:</b> Hate waiting on hold? iOS 26 can keep you on hold with customer service for you and alert you when an agent is ready. That way, you don\u2019t miss your call while listening to on-hold music.</li>\n<li><b>Visual Intelligence:</b> Now you can take a screenshot of anything on your iPhone screen and instantly ask Siri or another assistant about it. For example, tap on an object to search for it online, or highlight text to translate or find related information without leaving the app.</li>\n<li><b>Enhanced Messages:</b> Group chats get new flair and tools. You can set dynamic backgrounds and create polls for easy group decision-making. There\u2019s also Apple Cash in group messages, and now you can see who\u2019s typing in group chats. Messages from unknown senders are automatically filtered out so you only see the conversations you want.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Which iPhones can run iOS 26?</h2>\n<p>Not all iPhones get the iOS 26 upgrade. Apple has dropped support for older models with the A12 chip and earlier. In practice, iOS 26 works on these devices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>iPhone 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max</li>\n<li>iPhone 12, 12 mini, 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max</li>\n<li>iPhone 13, 13 mini, 13 Pro, 13 Pro Max</li>\n<li>iPhone 14, 14 Plus, 14 Pro, 14 Pro Max</li>\n<li>iPhone 15, 15 Plus, 15 Pro, 15 Pro Max</li>\n<li>iPhone 16 series (all models) and the new iPhone Air</li>\n<li>iPhone 17 series (all models)</li>\n<li>iPhone SE (2nd generation and 3rd generation)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Older phones like the iPhone XS, XR, or the first iPhone SE won\u2019t get this update. If your device is on the list above, you can install iOS 26 from the Settings app.</p>\n<h2>When is iOS 26 available and how to upgrade?</h2>\n<p>Apple released iOS 26 on September 15, 2025 as a free update. The rollout was global and simultaneous, timed along with updates to iPadOS, macOS Tahoe, watchOS 26 and more. To get the update, open <b>Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update</b> on your iPhone and follow the prompts. (Make sure you have enough battery or are plugged in, and a recent backup.)</p>\n<h2>What\u2019s new in other apps?</h2>\n<p>Beyond design and AI, iOS 26 refines many built-in apps. The Camera app is streamlined for faster switching between photo and video modes. Battery settings now use color-coded charts to highlight heavy usage, and a new Adaptive Power mode can save juice when you need it most. Apple Wallet gets travel-friendly upgrades like interactive boarding passes and airport maps. A new Apple Games app brings all your games and friends\u2019 scores into one place.</p>\n<h2>Apple\u2019s vision for iOS 26</h2>\n<p>According to Apple\u2019s design team, iOS 26 was built to balance beauty and utility. Drawing on ideas from visionOS and leveraging the power of Apple silicon, Liquid Glass makes every element feel alive. The result is a design that\u2019s instantly familiar yet filled with subtle motion and depth. On the intelligence side, Apple has woven AI into the system so features like translation in calls and smart shortcuts work seamlessly. All this happens on-device to keep your data private.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/whats-new-in-ios-26-iphfed2c4091/ios\">What\u2019s new in iOS 26 \u2013 Apple Support</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/in/os/ios/\">iOS 26 Official Features and Design \u2013 Apple</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/new-versions-of-apples-software-platforms-are-available-today/\">Apple Newsroom: iOS 26 with Liquid Glass and AI</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-ios-26-released-26-new-features-of-apples-biggest-software-update-of-2025-for-iphones/articleshow/123913609.cms\">Times of India: iOS 26 New Features</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/ios-26-and-ipados-26-compatibility-explained-which-models-are-supported\">TechRadar: iOS 26 Compatibility</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2025/09/09/when-ios-26-release-date/86062671007/\">USA Today: iOS 26 Release Date</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

  "content": "<p>In a <strong>significant move</strong> that could reshape the future of artificial intelligence, Microsoft and OpenAI have announced a new non-binding agreement that marks the next phase of their partnership. This deal allows OpenAI to restructure into a for-profit company, potentially paving the way for an <strong>initial public offering (IPO)</strong>. The announcement signals a milestone for AI innovation, investment, and the evolving relationship between two of the biggest players in the tech industry.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>What the New Deal Entails</h2>\n        <p>\n            Since Microsoft’s first investment in OpenAI in 2019, totaling over <strong>$13 billion</strong> to date, the two companies have maintained a close yet evolving partnership. The newly revealed agreement revises the existing terms to enable OpenAI to raise capital more traditionally, under a for-profit model, while still preserving the strategic influence and extensive support from Microsoft.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Additionally, the agreement enables OpenAI to expand its cloud partnerships beyond Microsoft Azure, allowing collaborations with other cloud providers such as <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Cloud</a> and Oracle. This cloud-provider diversification taps into growing AI demand and enhances OpenAI’s flexibility for deploying its services globally.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3>Key Highlights of the Deal</h3>\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>OpenAI will restructure</strong> from a nonprofit to a for-profit entity, unlocking new investment opportunities.</li>\n            <li><strong>Microsoft retains a major stake</strong> and influence in OpenAI, maintaining access to cutting-edge AI technologies.</li>\n            <li>OpenAI gains permission to collaborate with other cloud providers, diversifying its infrastructure partnerships.</li>\n            <li>The nonprofit parent entity retains a controlling interest, ensuring long-term mission alignment.</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h2>Why This Matters for AI and Tech Industry</h2>\n        <p>\n            OpenAI’s shift to a for-profit structure with plans for an IPO reflects the accelerating demand for even more powerful AI capabilities. Such restructuring allows OpenAI to attract significant outside investment necessary to fund resource-intensive development of models like GPT-4 and beyond. For Microsoft, this partnership doubles down on its AI ambitions by positioning itself as the primary cloud provider while benefiting from the latest AI innovations.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The combined move underscores the broader trend of AI becoming a central pillar for software companies and cloud service providers. Industry experts expect increased competition among tech giants for AI dominance, spurring faster technological advancements and more accessible AI-powered tools.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3>Impact on Developers, Businesses, and Users</h3>\n        <p>\n            The Microsoft-OpenAI partnership evolution brings several potential benefits to developers and businesses across industries:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>More Investment in AI Tools:</strong> With stronger funding channels, expect accelerated development of AI applications across sectors.</li>\n            <li><strong>Enhanced Cloud Access:</strong> The multi-cloud approach improves reliability and compliance options for users.</li>\n            <li><strong>Better AI Integration:</strong> Businesses can harness AI capabilities more easily within existing Microsoft products and new offerings.</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h2>Partnership Overview Table</h2>\n        <table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"8\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n            <thead>\n                <tr>\n                    <th>Aspect</th>\n                    <th>Details</th>\n                </tr>\n            </thead>\n            <tbody>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>Microsoft Investment</td>\n                    <td><strong>Over $13 billion</strong> since 2019</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>OpenAI Structure</td>\n                    <td>Restructuring from nonprofit to for-profit entity</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>Cloud Partnerships</td>\n                    <td>Expanding beyond Azure to Oracle, Google Cloud</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>IPO Plans</td>\n                    <td>Potential IPO as part of for-profit shift</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>Governance</td>\n                    <td>Nonprofit parent retains controlling interest</td>\n                </tr>\n            </tbody>\n        </table>\n\n        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>\n        <p>\n            As OpenAI prepares to scale through this new financial structure, the AI ecosystem is likely to experience heightened levels of innovation, competition, and investment. An IPO would provide investors a rare opportunity to own shares in a leading AI company, while Microsoft strengthens its position as a critical AI infrastructure provider. For technology sectors and customers, these developments promise faster access to more advanced AI capabilities integrated into everyday tools.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n            For more detailed insights on this evolving partnership, readers can visit <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/joint-statement-from-openai-and-microsoft/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OpenAI's official joint statement</a> or review the <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/09/11/a-joint-statement-from-microsoft-and-openai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Microsoft blog announcement</a>.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>References</h2>\n        <ul>\n            <li><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/microsoft-openai-reach-non-binding-deal-allow-openai-restructure-2025-09-11/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reuters: Microsoft, OpenAI reach non-binding deal</a></li>\n            <li><a href=\"https://openai.com/index/joint-statement-from-openai-and-microsoft/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OpenAI & Microsoft Joint Statement</a></li>\n            <li><a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/09/11/a-joint-statement-from-microsoft-and-openai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Microsoft Blog: Joint Statement with OpenAI</a></li>\n            <li><a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/09/11/open-ai-microsoft-agreement-deal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Axios: OpenAI and Microsoft reach tentative deal</a></li>\n            <li><a href=\"https://economictimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/explained-openai-and-microsofts-new-agreement-allowing-major-restructuring/articleshow/123845251.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Economic Times: Explained - OpenAI and Microsoft’s new agreement</a></li>\n        </ul>",

  "content": "\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n\n<p>In the AI race, compute is power. OpenAI has taken that idea to the extreme by signing a <strong>$300 billion contract with Oracle</strong>, making it one of the largest cloud infrastructure deals ever. Starting in 2027, Oracle will provide <strong>4.5 gigawatts of computing capacity</strong>, fueling OpenAI’s next-generation AI models and services.</p>\n\n<p>This deal is part of <strong>Project Stargate</strong>, a massive initiative backed by OpenAI, Oracle, SoftBank, and MGX, with an eye on investing up to <strong>$500 billion in AI infrastructure</strong> by the end of the decade. Stargate isn’t just about technology — it’s about re-industrializing the U.S., creating jobs, and cementing AI leadership on the global stage.</p>\n\n<h2>Why This Deal Matters</h2>\n\n<p>For <strong>Oracle</strong>, it’s a landmark win. Once trailing competitors in cloud services, Oracle is now at the center of the AI infrastructure conversation.</p>\n\n<p>For <strong>OpenAI</strong>, it’s about future-proofing. With AI compute shortages and rising chip costs, securing long-term capacity ensures OpenAI can continue scaling its frontier models.</p>\n\n<p>But such scale brings challenges:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Revenue pressure:</strong> OpenAI’s spending far outpaces its revenue. The company will need massive growth in enterprise AI adoption to make this bet sustainable.</li>\n  <li><strong>Tech evolution:</strong> AI hardware is advancing quickly. Locking into a long-term deal carries the risk of being stuck with infrastructure that may be outdated within years.</li>\n  <li><strong>Energy demand:</strong> 4.5 GW is an immense power requirement — raising questions about sustainability, environmental impact, and grid resilience.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>\n\n<p>Project Stargate represents more than servers and silicon. It’s about <strong>geopolitical positioning</strong> and ensuring that the U.S. remains the hub for AI innovation.</p>\n\n<p>Supporters frame it as visionary — a way to push AI to new heights. Skeptics see it as risky, warning that the economics of AI may not justify the investment.</p>\n\n<p>Either way, the stakes couldn’t be higher.</p>\n\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n<p>The OpenAI-Oracle deal is a <strong>bold leap into the future</strong> of artificial intelligence. If successful, it could power breakthroughs that reshape industries, economies, and daily life. If it falters, it may stand as one of the costliest missteps in tech history.</p>\n\n<p>One thing is clear: the future of AI will not only be written in code, but also built on <strong>infrastructure, energy, and vision</strong>.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n  <ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-oracle-data-center-ai-infrastructure-investment-2025-9\" target=\"_blank\">Business Insider – OpenAI’s Oracle Deal</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/10/technology/openai-oracle-data-centers-deal.html\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI Signs $300 Billion Data Center Pact With Tech - New York Times</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20250911VL202/openai-oracle-ai-infrastructure-revenue-2025.html\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI's US$300 billion Oracle deal underscores AI infrastructure boom - DigiTimes</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/news/story/oracle-and-openai-ink-300b-deal-6569964/\" target=\"_blank\">Oracle and OpenAI ink $300B deal - LinkedIn News</a></li>\n  \n  </ul>",

  "content": "<p>Google has taken a significant step in its global AI strategy by expanding AI Mode the company’s advanced AI chatbot for Search beyond English for the first time. Announced on September 7, 2025, users can now access AI Mode in Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, and Brazilian Portuguese, empowering millions to interact with AI-driven search in their native language.</p>\n\n<p>AI Mode leverages Google’s custom Gemini 2.5 Pro model, equipped with multimodal and deep reasoning capabilities. This means users can submit complex queries in their preferred language, using text, voice, or even images, and receive nuanced, locally relevant answers. It’s a leap beyond simple translation Google emphasizes that genuine multilingual search demands cultural awareness and local knowledge to be truly helpful.</p>\n\n<p>This expansion follows a rapid push of AI Mode worldwide: first launched in the United States as an experimental Labs feature, scaled to broader rollouts in the UK and India, and then to over 180 countries in English this summer. As of today, Google’s AI Mode is more accessible and personalized than ever, and the company has promised further enhancements, such as agentic capabilities for restaurant bookings and event planning, particularly for AI Mode Ultra subscribers.</p>\n\n<p>In a blog post, Hema Budaraju, VP of Product Management for Search, explained: “Our most advanced AI search capabilities are locally relevant and useful in each new language we support. Building a truly global Search goes far beyond translation it requires a nuanced understanding of local information.” This aligns with recent updates to Google’s AI search features, most notably the integration of Gemini’s multimodal input, conversational follow-ups, and agentic tools for concrete actions, such as booking reservations, directly from search results.</p>\n\n<p>However, the rapid expansion of AI Mode and Google’s broader AI search strategy has sparked discussion in the publishing and SEO worlds. While Google claims that web traffic from Search has remained “relatively stable” since the introduction of AI Overviews, some court filings reveal concerns that the “open web is already in rapid decline.” Publishers face challenges as AI-powered summary and answer engines increasingly satisfy user intent without requiring traditional web clicks raising questions about the future of organic traffic and content discovery.</p>\n\n\n<strong>Additional References:</strong>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/ai-mode-expands-more-languages/\">Google Blog: AI Mode expands to more languages</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/google-expands-ai-mode-beyond-english-461680\">Search Engine Land: Google expands AI Mode beyond English</a></li><li><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/08/googles-ai-mode-adds-5-new-languages-including-hindi-japanese-and-korean/\">TechCrunch: Google’s AI Mode adds new languages</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/07/22/google-users-are-less-likely-to-click-on-links-when-an-ai-summary-appears-in-the-results\">Pew Research: Declining Web Clicks in the Age of AI Search</a></li>\n</ol>\n",

  "content": "<p>Big data has long been heralded as a game-changer for enterprises, yet one persistent problem continues to inhibit its full potential: the disconnect between those who build and maintain data infrastructure and the business users who need actionable insights from that data. Addressing this issue, Arun Murthy, former CTO of Scale AI and one of the original architects behind Hadoop, has launched a groundbreaking AI startup, Isotopes AI, that promises to revolutionize how businesses access and use their data.</p>\n\n<p>Emerging from stealth mode with a $20 million seed funding round led by Vab Goel at NTTVC, Isotopes AI introduces Aidnn - an AI agent designed to bridge this critical gap. Unlike traditional analytics tools, Aidnn leverages cutting-edge large language models (LLMs) and agentic AI to allow business managers to query complex data across their finance, ERP, CRM, and cloud storage platforms using natural language.</p>\n\n<p>Murthy’s unparalleled expertise, cultivated over two decades of experience including co-founding Hortonworks (which commercialized Hadoop) and serving as CTO at Scale AI, uniquely positions him to tackle this challenge head-on. Hadoop sparked the initial big data revolution in the 2010s by enabling large-scale data processing through distributed systems, but the rise of new cloud storage technologies has shifted the landscape dramatically. Murthy witnessed firsthand the frustrations of data companies struggling to provide timely and accurate business insights during his tenure at Cloudera and Scale AI.</p>\n\n<p>Aidnn goes far beyond a simple chatbot. It orchestrates multi-step, complex workflows such as metadata extraction, data cleaning and normalization, dataset integration, revenue proration, and aggregation—all essential tasks to transform raw data into meaningful insights. This sophisticated approach ensures that even data not readily available in the required format can be used effectively for decision-making.</p>\n\n<p>Transparency is a key differentiator for Isotopes AI. Aidnn not only provides answers but also explains its reasoning, assumptions, and highlights anomalies, helping users understand the underlying data quality and analytics process. Importantly, Isotopes ensures enterprise customers can deploy the AI without compromising data privacy or sharing sensitive information with third-party AI model providers.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the competitive landscape—with established players like Salesforce’s Tableau offering AI-powered analytics agents—Isotopes AI’s unique combination of pedigree and technology offers a fresh approach to democratizing big data access. Isotopes demonstrates how specialized AI agents can unlock previously inaccessible insights, empowering business teams to make faster, data-driven decisions without depending heavily on data engineers.</p>\n\n<p>As AI continues to reshape enterprise analytics in 2025 and beyond, Isotopes AI and its Aidnn agent represent a promising leap forward in closing the big data access gap, enabling businesses to fully harness the power of their data assets.</p>",

  "content": "<p>The study is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>\n\n<p>Led by Jake Russin, a postdoctoral research associate in computer science at Brown University, the study found by training an AI system that flexible and incremental learning modes interact similarly to working memory and long-term memory in humans.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\"These results help explain why a human looks like a rule-based learner in some circumstances and an incremental learner in others,\" Russin said. \"They also suggest something about what the newest AI systems have in common with the human brain.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Russin holds a joint appointment in the laboratories of Michael Frank, a professor of cognitive and psychological sciences and director of the Center for Computational Brain Science at Brown's Carney Institute for Brain Science, and Ellie Pavlick, an associate professor of computer science who leads the AI Research Institute on Interaction for AI Assistants at Brown.</p>\n\n<p>Depending on the task, humans acquire new information in one of two ways. For some tasks, such as learning the rules of tic-tac-toe, \"in-context\" learning allows people to figure out the rules quickly after a few examples. In other instances, incremental learning builds on information to improve understanding over time such as the slow, sustained practice involved in learning to play a song on the piano.</p>\n\n<p>While researchers knew that humans and AI integrate both forms of learning, it wasn't clear how the two learning types work together. Over the course of the research team's ongoing collaboration, Russin whose work bridges machine learning and computational neuroscience developed a theory that the dynamic might be similar to the interplay of human working memory and long-term memory.</p>\n\n<p>To test this theory, Russin used \"meta-learning\" a type of training that helps AI systems learn about the act of learning itself to tease out key properties of the two learning types. The experiments revealed that the AI system's ability to perform in-context learning emerged after it meta-learned through multiple examples.</p>\n\n<p>One experiment, adapted from an experiment in humans, tested for in-context learning by challenging the AI to recombine similar ideas to deal with new situations. If taught about a list of colors and a list of animals, could the AI correctly identify a combination of color and animal (e.g. a green giraffe) it had not seen together previously? After the AI meta-learned by being challenged to 12,000 similar tasks, it gained the ability to successfully identify new combinations of colors and animals.</p>\n\n<p>The results suggest that for both humans and AI, quicker, flexible in-context learning arises after a certain amount of incremental learning has taken place.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\"At the first board game, it takes you a while to figure out how to play,\" Pavlick said. \"By the time you learn your hundredth board game, you can pick up the rules of play quickly, even if you've never seen that particular game before.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The team also found trade-offs, including between learning retention and flexibility: Similar to humans, the harder it is for AI to correctly complete a task, the more likely it will remember how to perform it in the future. According to Frank, who has studied this paradox in humans, this is because errors cue the brain to update information stored in long-term memory, whereas error-free actions learned in context increase flexibility but don't engage long-term memory in the same way.</p>\n\n<p>For Frank, who specializes in building biologically inspired computational models to understand human learning and decision-making, the team's work showed how analyzing strengths and weaknesses of different learning strategies in an artificial neural network can offer new insights about the human brain.</p>\n\n<p>\"Our results hold reliably across multiple tasks and bring together disparate aspects of human learning that neuroscientists hadn't grouped together until now,\" Frank said.</p>\n\n\n<p>The work also suggests important considerations for developing intuitive and trustworthy AI tools, particularly in sensitive domains such as mental health.</p>",

Make it friendly and easy to understand.\"</code></p>\n<p><i>Tip:</i> Always tell the AI <b>how to write</b>, not just <b>what to write</b>.</p>\n\n<h3>🎯 Step 2: Choose a Friendly Tone</h3>\n<p>Ask the AI to sound like:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>A friend having a chat</li>\n  <li>A teacher explaining something clearly</li>\n  <li>A blogger using casual language</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can say things like:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  “Write in a fun and relaxed tone.”<br>\n  “Use everyday words.”<br>\n  “Avoid sounding too formal.”\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>💬 Step 3: Add Emotion and Expression</h3>\n<p>Real people use feeling words and expressions.</p>\n<p><b>✅ Examples:</b></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>“Honestly, that blew my mind!”</li>\n  <li>“Wow, that’s pretty cool.”</li>\n  <li>“Let’s face it, nobody likes long emails.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can add these by hand or ask the AI to use them.</p>\n\n<h3>✂️ Step 4: Cut the Fluff</h3>\n<p>AI sometimes uses too many words or repeats ideas.</p>\n<p><b>❌ Example:</b><br>\n<code>“In conclusion, we can finally conclude that the conclusion is important.”</code></p>\n<p><b>✅ Human-sounding version:</b><br>\n<code>“So yeah, that’s why it matters.”</code></p>\n<p>Edit your AI text and remove repeated phrases, boring intros, or long sentences.</p>\n\n<h3>📚 Step 5: Use Examples or Stories</h3>\n<p>Humans connect better with examples, stories, or real situations.</p>\n<p><b>✅ Example:</b></p>\n<blockquote>\n  “I used an AI tool to write my newsletter—and guess what? People replied saying it felt personal!”\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can add short stories like that to make the text more relatable.</p>\n\n<h3>🤖 Step 6: Use AI Tools to Help</h3>\n<p>Here are some tools that help make text sound more human:</p>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"8\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Tool</th>\n      <th>What it Does</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td><a href=\"https://www.grammarly.com\" target=\"_blank\">Grammarly</a></td>\n      <td>Fixes tone and grammar</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><a href=\"https://www.wordtune.com\" target=\"_blank\">Wordtune</a></td>\n      <td>Rewrites text in a human voice</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><a href=\"https://hemingwayapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hemingway App</a></td>\n      <td>Makes writing clear and simple</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><a href=\"https://quillbot.com\" target=\"_blank\">QuillBot</a></td>\n      <td>Rephrases and shortens text</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>AI-generated text can be powerful, but often lacks a natural, human touch. In this guide, you’ll learn six simple steps to make AI text sound more like it was written by a real person. From writing better prompts to using emotional language, trimming fluff, and adding personal stories—this blog walks you through exactly how to improve your AI writing.
